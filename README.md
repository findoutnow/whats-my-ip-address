The term IP address stands for Internet Protocol address. An Internet Protocol address is a unique numerical name that every electronic device connected to a computer network has.

You can think of an IP address as being similar to your home address. It is specific to that particular device and serves as a way to identify and locate these devices. There are currently two types of IP addresses used: IPv4 and IPv6.

## What you should know about your IP address ?

Generally speaking, your IP address is public and can be used by others to find out where you (or your device) is located.

However, you shouldn't worry that strangers might be able to discover personal information about you simply by knowing your IP address. While the address might say that your computer is located in a particular city or state, it can't reveal your name, address, phone number, or other identifying information.
